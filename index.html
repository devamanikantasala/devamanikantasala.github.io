            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Hello! I am Deva, pursuing Bachelor of Computer Applications. As part of my final semester I did internshipat IGIAT-Vishakapatnam.Indo German Institute of Advanced Technologies - IGIAT in vishakapatnam is known for its advanced technical education & skill development programs. I am so grateful to join their internship program, which was totally focused on <b>"Application Development Using Python"</b>. Our program was well-organized, with covering a wide range of topics over several weeks. We started from scratch with basics of computer science concepts and moved on to more advanced python programming techniques. The highlight of our internship was creating a chatbot using "<code>chatterbot</code>" framework and "<code>flask</code>" as web framework to give interface to the project. This project allowed us to use the skills we had learned.</p>

            <h2>Chatbot Creation</h2>
            <p>The first step in my project was to create the basic structure of the chatbot using the ChatterBot library. I set up the environment, installed necessary packages, and initialized the chatbot. This involved configuring the chatbot to use various adapters and setting up the database to store conversations. Below is a glimpse of the directory structure:</p>

            <h2>Training the Chatbot</h2>
            <p>Training the chatbot was a critical part of the project. I utilized several predefined conversation sets to train the chatbot using ChatterBot's ListTrainer. This step ensured that the chatbot could handle basic conversational queries and respond appropriately. Additionally, I exported and cleaned a real-world WhatsApp chat to provide a rich dataset for training, enhancing the chatbot's conversational abilities.</p>

        <section id="integration">
            <h2>Integrating Gemini AI</h2>
            <p>To improve the chatbot's responses when confidence levels were low, I integrated Gemini AI using its API key. This integration allowed the chatbot to leverage advanced generative AI capabilities for more accurate and contextually relevant responses. The integration process involved configuring the API, setting a confidence threshold, and using Gemini AI for fallback responses.</p>

        <section id="deployment">
            <h2>Project Deployment</h2>
            <p>After completing the development and training phases, I deployed the project on GitHub. The deployment involved creating two repositories: one for all internship resources and another specifically for the chatbot project. Additionally, I recorded two videos in Telugu to explain the process of creating the chatbot and guide my teammates on how to accomplish similar projects. The project can be accessed at the following repositories:</p>
