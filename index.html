            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Hello! I am Deva, pursuing Bachelor of Computer Applications. As part of my final semester I did internship at IGIAT-Vishakapatnam.Indo German Institute of Advanced Technologies - IGIAT in vishakapatnam is known for its advanced technical education & skill development programs. I am so grateful to join their internship program, which was totally focused on <b>"Application Development Using Python"</b>. Our program was well-organized, with covering a wide range of topics over several weeks. We started from scratch with basics of computer science concepts and moved on to more advanced python programming techniques. The highlight of our internship was creating a chatbot using "<b><code style="font-size: 19px;">chatterbot</code></b>" framework and "<b><code style="font-size: 19px;">flask</code></b>" as web framework to give interface to the project. This project allowed us to use the skills we had learned.</p>

            <h2>Chatbot Creation</h2>
            <p>During our internship, we did entire coursework on python about 11 weeks, by covering basic topics to more advanced topics like web scraping, web development, and working with api's many more. For the actual internship of 15 weeks, the remaining 4 weeks were alloted and assigned for us to do the project work based on the skills that we have attained on coursework. So for the project we have choosen to create a ChatBot, for myself I named it as <b>Vortex-BOT</b>, and based on this theme, we researched about the resources that would enhance the functionality of our chatbot. We later on found that <b>Chatterbot</b> and <b>Rasa</b> are the most popular frameworks used by python developers to train the chatbot, and create the chatbots. So based on their merits and demerits we choosen <b><code style="font-size: 19px;">chatterbot</code></b> for our project. We gained the exposure on its documentation <a href="https://chatterbot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" target="_blank">Here!</a>. After gaining the theoretical exposure on Chatterbot library, we were started to create a virtual environment for our project. This virtual envirtual environment is named as <b>Internship-Project</b>. We installed <b><code style="font-size: 19px;">virtualenv</code></b> framework to create a virtual-environment. This further allowed us to work on isolated environment with no disturbances on memory level. After creating the virtual environment the directory structure would look like as follows</p>
            <img src="images/directory-structure.png" alt="Directory Structure">
            <p>After, this to install all the modules in the virutal environment we tried to activate the virtual environment on terminal or command-prompt using the following command:<br><B>For Windows</B><br><code style="font-size: 19px;">Internship-Project\Scripts\activate</code><br><B>For Mac & Linux</B><br><code style="font-size: 19px;">source Internship-Project/bin/activate</code><br>After activating the virutal environments, we started to install all the necesssary modules to work on our project ChatBot.</p>
            <img src="images/modules-installed(requirements).png" alt="Modules Required">
            <p>You can find the detailed repository of our project at <a href="https://github.com/devamanikantasala/Internship-Project-Repository" target="_blank">Github</a> within that you can find the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devamanikantasala/Internship-Project-Repository/main/requirements.txt" target="_blank">requirements.txt</a> file that holds all the modules that have been installed to create our chatbot.</p>

            <h2>Training the Chatbot</h2>
            <p>Training the chatbot was a critical part of the project. I utilized several predefined conversation sets to train the chatbot using ChatterBot's ListTrainer. This step ensured that the chatbot could handle basic conversational queries and respond appropriately. Additionally, I exported and cleaned a real-world WhatsApp chat to provide a rich dataset for training, enhancing the chatbot's conversational abilities.</p>

        <section id="integration">
            <h2>Integrating Gemini AI</h2>
            <p>To improve the chatbot's responses when confidence levels were low, I integrated Gemini AI using its API key. This integration allowed the chatbot to leverage advanced generative AI capabilities for more accurate and contextually relevant responses. The integration process involved configuring the API, setting a confidence threshold, and using Gemini AI for fallback responses.</p>

        <section id="deployment">
            <h2>Project Deployment</h2>
            <p>After completing the development and training phases, I deployed the project on GitHub. The deployment involved creating two repositories: one for all internship resources and another specifically for the chatbot project. Additionally, I recorded two videos in Telugu to explain the process of creating the chatbot and guide my teammates on how to accomplish similar projects. The project can be accessed at the following repositories:</p>
